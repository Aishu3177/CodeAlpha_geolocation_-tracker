# CodeAlpha_geolocation_-tracker
To create a basic geolocation tracker in Python, you can use the geopy library for geocoding (turning an address into coordinates) or reverse geocoding (turning coordinates into an address). You can also track the location using a device's GPS, which is often done with libraries like gpsd (on Linux) or using geocoder for IP-based location tracking.
